- Queue -FIFO
A queue is a data structure in which the the  first element(head) is removed first, this data type is used when arrival data it matters, like when you are at a shop or anything like this, and you wait until your turn comes.
- Stack -LIFO
A stack is a data structure very similar to the queue, but in a stack the first element which is removed is the last element added, this type of data is used when the order of operations it matters, like in an algorithm. A stack work like this, let's consider a box, in which you put five books, stacked on top each other, so in order to reach first book that  you put in the box, you need to take all other books out first, and this is how the stack works, in order to reach the first element added you need to take all others elements

Arrays->
  Advanatages:
    - fast acces time by index O(1)
    - contigus block of memory, that means is more efficent from the of memory usage,
        especialy because in cache memory we load a contigus zone of memory, that make the acces of that way faster
 Disadvanges:
    - fixed size, you need to create another array to change the size
List->
    Advanatages:
        - dynamic size, easy resizeing
        - dynamic allocation of the memory
        - you can store different types of elements togheter
    Disadvanges:
        - slower time acces, you need to iterate thru the list to find an element;

 HTTP/HTTPS are communications protocls used fro transmitting data over the internet,
    both use TCP protocl(80/HTTP, 443/HTTPS - default ports), the difference is that HTTPS use SSL/TLS to encrypt the 
    data transmitted between the client and the server;

4. HTTP codes;
200- OK
400 - BAD_REQUEST
404 - NOT_FOUND
429 - TOO_MANY_REQUESTS
500 - INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
403 - FORBIDDEN

5. 
authorization - what you cand do, where you have access
authentication - who you are, prof that you are who you pretend to be
